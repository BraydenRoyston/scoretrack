ScoreTrack App, Description & Brainstorm

MVP: 
- web app to display score and the name of the party on either side
- user can add an 'event' which updates the score and contains the following information:
	- game / activity
	- which side won the game/activity
	- the number of points given to the game
	- the date of the game
- user can view the history of events

FUTURE IDEAS:
- filter event history based on date, which updates the scores shown
- add event types that are saved to that game, the user can then filter these event types to see 
the score of a specific type of game
